### About

This project analyzes match attendance data from the Argentine Primera División to understand what factors drive variation in crowd size across games.

Using Bayesian modeling, I examine how attendance depends on:
- the team playing
- the day of the week
- overall league-level trends

The analysis focuses on separating real structural effects from noise and handling missing data in a principled way.
